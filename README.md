# Twitter-AI

This project was for me to display differently trained models like naive bayes, SVM and random forest.
The models are trained on users tweets, and try to predict its polarity. So wether a tweet is positive or negative.

As an extra, I made a wordcloud that is based on all the tweets for each user.
